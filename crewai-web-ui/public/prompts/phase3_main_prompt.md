**`main.py` Generation Logic:**

Your task is to generate the content for the `main.py` file, which serves as the entry point for the CrewAI project and is compatible with the `crewai` CLI. Use the JSON object provided as the single source of truth.

**Objective:**
Generate a Python script based on the provided template. The script must dynamically create an `inputs` dictionary for the `run()`, `train()`, and `test()` functions based on the placeholders found in the task descriptions from the input JSON.

No explication shoudl be provided, just output the code.


**Template:**
Use the following Python code as a template for the `main.py` file.


```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import warnings
from datetime import datetime
from crewai_generated.crew import CrewaiGenerated

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=SyntaxWarning, module="pysbd")

# This main file is intended to be a way for you to run your
# crew locally, so refrain from adding unnecessary logic into this file.
# Replace with inputs you want to test with, it will automatically
# interpolate any tasks and agents information

def run():
    """
    Run the crew.
    """
    # Dynamically generated inputs will be placed here
    inputs = {}
    try:
        CrewaiGenerated().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"An error occurred while running the crew: {e}")

def train():
    """
    Train the crew for a given number of iterations.
    """
    # Dynamically generated inputs will be placed here
    inputs = {}
    try:
        CrewaiGenerated().crew().train(n_iterations=int(sys.argv[1]), filename=sys.argv[2], inputs=inputs)
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"An error occurred while training the crew: {e}")

def replay():
    """
    Replay the crew execution from a specific task.
    """
    try:
        CrewaiGenerated().crew().replay(task_id=sys.argv[1])
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"An error occurred while replaying the crew: {e}")

def test():
    """
    Test the crew execution and returns the results.
    """
    # Dynamically generated inputs will be placed here
    inputs = {}
    try:
        CrewaiGenerated().crew().test(n_iterations=int(sys.argv[1]), eval_llm=sys.argv[2], inputs=inputs)
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"An error occurred while testing the crew: {e}")
