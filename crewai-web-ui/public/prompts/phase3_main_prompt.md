**`main.py` Generation Logic:**

Your task is to generate the content for the `main.py` file, which serves as the entry point for the CrewAI project and is compatible with the `crewai` CLI. Use the JSON object provided as the single source of truth.

**Objective:**
Generate a Python script based on the provided template. The script must dynamically create an `inputs` dictionary for the `run()`, `train()`, and `test()` functions based on the placeholders found in the task descriptions from the input JSON.

**Template:**
Use the following Python code as a template for the `main.py` file.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import warnings
from datetime import datetime
from crewai_generated.crew import CrewaiGenerated

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=SyntaxWarning, module="pysbd")

# This main file is intended to be a way for you to run your
# crew locally, so refrain from adding unnecessary logic into this file.
# Replace with inputs you want to test with, it will automatically
# interpolate any tasks and agents information

def run():
    """
    Run the crew.
    """
    # Dynamically generated inputs will be placed here
    inputs = {}
    try:
        CrewaiGenerated().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"An error occurred while running the crew: {e}")

def train():
    """
    Train the crew for a given number of iterations.
    """
    # Dynamically generated inputs will be placed here
    inputs = {}
    try:
        CrewaiGenerated().crew().train(n_iterations=int(sys.argv[1]), filename=sys.argv[2], inputs=inputs)
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"An error occurred while training the crew: {e}")

def replay():
    """
    Replay the crew execution from a specific task.
    """
    try:
        CrewaiGenerated().crew().replay(task_id=sys.argv[1])
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"An error occurred while replaying the crew: {e}")

def test():
    """
    Test the crew execution and returns the results.
    """
    # Dynamically generated inputs will be placed here
    inputs = {}
    try:
        CrewaiGenerated().crew().test(n_iterations=int(sys.argv[1]), eval_llm=sys.argv[2], inputs=inputs)
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"An error occurred while testing the crew: {e}")
```

**Instructions for dynamic `inputs` generation:**

1.  **Inspect Task Descriptions:** Go through each task in the `task_roster` list from the input JSON. Look at the `description` field for each task.
2.  **Identify Placeholders:** Find all unique placeholders within the descriptions. A placeholder is a string enclosed in curly braces, for example: `{topic}` or `{customer_name}`.
3.  **Generate the `inputs` Dictionary:** For each unique placeholder you found, create a key in the `inputs` dictionary. The key should be the name of the placeholder without the curly braces.
4.  **Assign Default Values:** Assign a sensible, generic, and simple string value to each key. For example, for a key named `topic`, a good value would be `'AI in healthcare'`. For a key named `customer_name`, a good value would be `'John Doe'`. If a placeholder suggests a year (e.g. `{current_year}`), use `str(datetime.now().year)` as the value.
5.  **Placement:** The generated `inputs` dictionary should replace the `inputs = {}` line in the `run()`, `train()`, and `test()` functions within the template. The `replay()` function does not require inputs.

**Example:**

If the task descriptions contain `{topic}` and `{current_year}`, the generated `inputs` dictionary inside the `run()` function should look like this:

```python
    inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI LLMs',
        'current_year': str(datetime.now().year)
    }
```

Ensure the final output is a single, valid Python script for `main.py`.
