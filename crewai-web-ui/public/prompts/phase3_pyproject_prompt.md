**`pyproject.toml` Generation Logic:**

Use the JSON object provided as the single source of truth. Your task is to generate the content for the `pyproject.toml` file.

*   **Objective:** Create a `pyproject.toml` file that defines the project's dependencies.
*   **Content:**
    *   Define the `[tool.poetry]` section with basic project information like `name`, `version`, `description`, and `authors`.
    *   Define the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section.
        *   Include `python = ">=3.10,<4.0"`.
        *   Include `crewai = "latest"`.
        *   Include `crewai-tools = "latest"`.
        *   Include any other dependencies required by the generated code, such as `python-dotenv`.
    *   Define the `[build-system]` section.
*   **Formatting:**
    *   The output should be a single, valid TOML file.

**Example `pyproject.toml` Output:**

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "crewai-generated"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A CrewAI project generated by the CrewAI Web UI."
authors = ["CrewAI"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ">=3.10,<4.0"
crewai = "latest"
crewai-tools = "latest"
python-dotenv = "latest"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```
