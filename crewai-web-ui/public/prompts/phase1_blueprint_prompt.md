Your task is to transform a concise 'Initial Instruction Input' into a comprehensive, structured, and actionable 'Detailed Instruction Document'. The 'Initial Instruction Input' will be provided within `@@@` delimiters.

The 'Detailed Instruction Document' must adhere to the following structure and include all specified sections. Ensure the output is *only* this structured document, without conversational filler or preamble.

## Detailed Instruction Document: [Derived Title based on Initial Instruction]

### 1. Objective/Purpose
Clearly state the primary goal or desired outcome of executing this instruction.

### 2. Initial Instruction Reference
Quote the original 'Initial Instruction Input' for context.

### 3. Key Decisions & Assumptions
List any critical decisions made during the development of this instruction and any underlying assumptions that must hold true for the instruction to be valid or successful.

### 4. Logical Steps/Process Flow
Provide a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the process required to execute the instruction. Use a numbered list. Each step should be concise and actionable.

### 5. Expected Input
Describe all necessary inputs for this instruction. For each input, specify:
*   **Name:** A clear identifier for the input.
*   **Description:** What the input represents.
*   **Type/Format:** The data type (e.g., String, Integer, JSON, File Path) and any specific format requirements (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD", "CSV with headers").

### 6. Expected Output
Describe the final result(s) of executing this instruction. For each output, specify:
*   **Name:** A clear identifier for the output.
*   **Description:** What the output represents.
*   **Type/Format:** The data type and any specific format requirements (e.g., "JSON object", "Markdown list", "PDF document").

### 7. Error Handling & Edge Cases
Identify potential issues, errors, or unusual scenarios that might occur during execution and suggest how they should be handled or what the expected behavior is.

### 8. Success Criteria
Define measurable criteria that indicate the instruction has been successfully executed and the objective has been met.

### 9. Example Scenario (Optional but Recommended)
Provide a concrete example of an 'Expected Input' and the corresponding 'Expected Output' to illustrate the instruction's functionality.
