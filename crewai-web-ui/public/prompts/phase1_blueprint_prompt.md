Use the 'Initial Instruction Input' (from the `@@@` delimiters) to develop a well detailed blueprimt document.

**A. Primary Objective:**
* Content: A single, clear statement of the main goal.

**B. Execution Outline:**
* Content: A step-by-step workflow designed to achieve the Primary Objective.
    * Each step should clearly define its purpose, **expected input (including type/format)**, the operation to be performed, and **expected output (including type/format)**.
    * This outline **MUST** incorporate any technical specifications identified in Section C.
    * Detail the logical flow of data and operations between steps.


**C. Success Criteria (Overall Task):**
* Content: Broader key questions, analyses, or content requirements the system must meet beyond the deliverable format.

**D. Clarified Assumptions:**
* Content: Explicitly state ALL assumptions made during Blueprint formulation (e.g., about data availability, interpretation of ambiguous requests).
