## Define Blueprint

**Input:** User-provided 'Initial Instruction Input' (from the `@@@` delimiters).

**Process:**
1.  Thoroughly analyze the 'Initial Instruction Input'.
2.  Identify ambiguities, missing information, or implicit requirements.
3.  Formulate the 'Blueprint' by augmenting and structuring the user's request, ensuring all pertinent details from the 'Initial Instruction Input' are captured.

**Output:** A 'Blueprint' document. This document is a structured representation generated by the AI, containing all sections defined below. It serves as the **direct and complete input** for the subsequent architecture design.

**'Blueprint' - Mandatory Sections:**

**A. Primary Objective:**
*   Content: Single, clear statement of the main goal.

**B. Deliverable(s):**
*   Content: Precise specification of ALL final outputs.
    *   Filename(s) and format(s) (e.g., `analysis_report.md`, `results.json`).
    *   Detailed structure (e.g., Markdown sections, JSON schema, data fields).
*   Constraint: This deliverable **MUST** be the direct result of a defined task or step in the execution outline.
*   Deliverable Success Criteria: How to assess the correctness and quality of the final deliverable(s).

**C. Information Assets & Technical Specifications:**
*   Content:
    *   List ALL required data sources/information types.
    *   **File types and their intended processing** (e.g., 'extract all text from PDF `main.pdf`', 'summarize DOCX content from `report.docx`', 'query data from `data.csv`'). This information is crucial for selecting or designing appropriate tools.
    *   Specific URLs for web tools or external services (if any).
    *   Descriptions of local files/databases (assume accessibility if mentioned).
    *   Keywords/strategies for research or data gathering (which may imply tool needs like web search).
    *   APIs (if any), including authentication details if provided in the input.
    *   List ALL technical specifications provided in the 'Initial Instruction Input' (e.g., required libraries, algorithms, performance constraints, specific tool versions, hardware/software environment constraints).
*   A list of requirements omitted from the final Blueprint, and the reasoning.

**D. Success Criteria (Overall Task):**
*   Content: Broader key questions, analyses, or content requirements the system must meet beyond the deliverable format.

**E. Operational Context:**
*   Content: Purpose of the output and its intended audience.

**F. Clarified Assumptions:**
*   Content: Explicitly state ALL assumptions made during Blueprint formulation (e.g., about data availability, tool compatibility, interpretation of ambiguous requests).

**G. Execution Outline:**
*   Content: A high-level, step-by-step workflow designed to achieve the Primary Objective.
    *   Each step should clearly define its purpose, **expected input (including type/format, e.g., 'text string', 'PDF file path')**, the operation to be performed, and **expected output (including type/format, e.g., 'markdown text', 'JSON data')**. This detail is vital for tool selection.
    *   This outline **MUST** incorporate any technical specifications identified in Section C.
    *   For each technical specification, provide clear reasoning for its integration into specific step(s), explaining its contribution or constraints.
    *   Detail the logical flow of data and operations between steps.
