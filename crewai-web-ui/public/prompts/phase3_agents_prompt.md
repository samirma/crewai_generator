Based on the blueprint, please generate the content for the `agents.yaml` file.

Analyze the "Blueprint" to identify the necessary roles, goals, and backstories for each agent. Define each agent in the YAML format, including `role`, `goal`, and `backstory`.

Make sure to interpolate any variables that will be passed from the `main.py` file (e.g., `{topic}`).
